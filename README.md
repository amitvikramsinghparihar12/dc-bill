An enterprise-grade, high-performance financial management web application built for **Greater Bengaluru Authority (GBA Corporation)**, Government of Karnataka.

This platform replaces legacy no-code departmental workflows with an **ACID-compliant, high-concurrency web application** featuring **multi-level Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, **strict Drawing and Disbursing Officer (DDO) budget cap tracking**, **statutory tax and deduction schedules**, and **offline RTGS bank advice generation**.

## 🎯 Executive Summary & Problem Statement

### The Legacy Problem
Government municipal corporations often manage hundreds of crores across civil works, transport infrastructure, and sanitation. Legacy solutions (spreadsheets or dated no-code databases) suffered from critical failure modes:
1. **Budget Over-commitment / Double-Spending:** Multiple Creators in the same DDO could simultaneously submit bills exceeding the authorized budget ceiling due to lack of write isolation.
2. **Lack of Audit Immutability:** Historical bill modifications and password overrides could be overwritten without forensic trace.
3. **DDO Data Leakage:** Officers in Division A could inspect or alter contracts belonging to Division B.
4. **Manual RTGS Generation:** Bank advice letters had to be manually typed, introducing human errors in IFSC codes, bank account numbers, and amount words.

### The Solution: GBA DC-BMS
- **ACID Transaction Engine:** All mutations are executed through a serialized promise queue with automatic rollback on invariant violations.
- **Strict DDO Data Isolation:** Filtered server-side and client-side; operational roles cannot access cross-division records.
- **Gross-Value Reservation:** Budgets are reserved immediately at bill submission using Gross Value ($Base + CGST + SGST + IGST$), preventing over-commitment.
- **Automated Rejection Refunds:** Rejections release reserved amounts back to the DDO allocation instantly.
- **Dual-Signatory Bank Advice:** Electronic RTGS advices generated in 1-click with Indian numbering words and `@media print` layout.

### Core Invariants Enforced
| Invariant | Implementation Mechanism | Violation Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **DDO Cap Adherence** | `grossValue <= alloc.remaining` verified inside transaction | Throws exact message: `"Insufficient DDO Budget Balance."` |
| **Allocation Floor** | DDO allocation cannot be set below currently `utilized` amount | Mutation aborted; error returned to Finance Officer |

## 💰 Statutory Financial Calculation & Deductions

### Calculations Engine (`src/utils/calc.ts`)
$$\text{Gross Value} = \text{Base Value} + \text{CGST} + \text{SGST} + \text{IGST}$$
$$\text{Total Deductions} = \sum_{i=1}^{16} \text{Deduction Head}_i$$
$$\text{Net Payable} = \text{Gross Value} - \text{Total Deductions}$$

> **Constraint:** Net Payable cannot be negative. If deductions exceed gross value, submission is blocked.

### 16 Statutory Deductions Supported
1. Income Tax TDS (u/s 194C / 194J)
2. GST TDS (CGST + SGST @ 2%)
3. Labour Welfare Cess (@ 1%)
4. Security Deposit / Retention Money (@ 5%)
5. Performance Security Recovery
6. Mobilization Advance Recovery
7. Material Issue Recovery (Cement/Steel)
8. Penalty / Liquidated Damages for Delay
9. Royalty on Minerals / Earth / Stone
10. Quality Control Testing Charges
11. Karnataka Stamp Duty Recovery
12. Water & Electricity Consumption Charges
13. Equipment & Machinery Hire Recovery
14. Defect Liability Period Retention
15. Safety Violation Fines
16. Other Statutory Miscellaneous Recovery

### Indian Numbering Format & Words
- Currency formatting conforms to the Indian number system: `₹ 1,25,00,000.00` (Crores and Lakhs).
- Cheque/Advice generation includes automated number-to-words conversion:
  *Example:* `₹ 52,31,000.00` $\rightarrow$ *"Fifty-Two Lakh Thirty-One Thousand Rupees Only"*.

## 🧪 Automated Verification Suite (10 Vitest Specifications)

The repository includes a comprehensive unit test suite covering all transactional and statutory constraints (`src/server/__tests__/system.test.ts`):

```bash
npx vitest run
```

```
 ✓ src/server/__tests__/system.test.ts (10 tests) 135ms
   ✓ 1. Gross/Net Calculation: correctly aggregates base + taxes, 16 deductions, blocks negative net
   ✓ 2. GSTIN, IFSC & DDO ID statutory format validation
   ✓ 3. Status lifecycle transition state machine
   ✓ 4. Budget check boundary: gross == remaining passes, gross > remaining fails with exact message
   ✓ 5. Reject releases budget: utilized reduces and remaining increases by grossValue
   ✓ 6. Concurrent submission race: promises serialized and second request rejects if balance insufficient
   ✓ 7. Atomic RTGS batch rollback: invalid bill in selection aborts entire batch with zero changes
   ✓ 8. DDO isolation: Creator 1 cannot view or modify DDO 2 bills
   ✓ 9. Permission denial: Verifier role cannot edit bills (HTTP 403 Forbidden)
   ✓ 10. Finance Officer invariant: cannot reduce DDO allocation below current utilized amount

 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  10 passed (10)

## 🗄️ PostgreSQL Production Reference Schema

For production deployment with PostgreSQL + Node.js, the database schema and SQL transaction design are defined in [`src/server/postgres_reference.sql`](src/server/postgres_reference.sql).

### Key PostgreSQL Constraints
```sql
-- DDO Allocation Floor & Cap Check
CREATE TABLE ddo_allocations (
    id VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
    grant_id VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL REFERENCES budget_grants(id),
    ddo_id VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES ddos(id),
    allocated NUMERIC(16, 2) NOT NULL CHECK (allocated >= 0),
    utilized NUMERIC(16, 2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00 CHECK (utilized >= 0),
    CONSTRAINT chk_utilized_within_cap CHECK (utilized <= allocated)
);

-- Atomic SQL Concurrency Query for Bill Submission
UPDATE ddo_allocations
SET utilized = utilized + :gross_value,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE ddo_id = :ddo_id
  AND (allocated - utilized) >= :gross_value;
-- If ROW_COUNT = 0, transaction rolls back with 'Insufficient DDO Budget Balance.'
```

## 💡 Technical Interview Deep Dive (FAQs)

**Q1: How does the application prevent double-spending in a multi-user environment?**  
*Answer:* In `/src/server/db.ts`, writes pass through a serialized mutation queue (`Promise` chain). State is deep-cloned for transaction isolation. The balance invariant `(allocated - utilized >= grossValue)` is re-evaluated inside the transaction right before committing. In PostgreSQL, this is enforced atomically using `UPDATE ... SET utilized = utilized + :gross WHERE (allocated - utilized) >= :gross`.

**Q2: Why reserve Gross Value rather than Net Payable?**  
*Answer:* Municipal accounting rules dictate that statutory deductions (TDS, GST TDS, Labour Cess, Security Deposit) are liabilities that the corporation must remit to tax and statutory authorities on behalf of the contractor. Therefore, the corporation's committed budget liability is the **Gross Value**.

**Q3: How is strict DDO isolation enforced?**  
*Answer:* Creators, Verifiers, and Approvers have mapped `ddoIds` in their profile. All query functions (`getBills`, `getBillById`, `getDdoAllocations`) enforce strict filtering. Cross-DDO write attempts are rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.

**Q4: How does the RTGS batch transaction maintain atomicity?**  
*Answer:* If any selected bill has already been batched or is not in `Pending RTGS` status, the batch generator aborts and rolls back the entire transaction. No bill is partially updated to `Paid`.
